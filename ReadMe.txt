Project Title: Solar Energy Decision Assistant

Authors: Sarah Hsu and Caryn Willis

Introduction: This project will allow the user to put in their coordinates and house and roof sizes in order to receive some useful data on solar energy power. This program will give a recommendation for solar panel brand, and whether or not the user should get solar power. In addition, there is second part where the user can visualize recommendations for a specific house and roof size in cities throughout the entire U.S.
